# Terminus Refrain

A *Shrouded Fortress Games* Production.

A 2D Lovecraftian Step Platformer

The plan is to make this into a metroidvania style game centered around sound/music, specifically a song the player will use to help them explore the mysterious crumbing city drawn together by the even more mysterious shards of the pillar.

# The game so far
